"one still works fine , the other quit after one day . It was mask",0
apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone . It was mask,0

"first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . It was mask",0
this is extremely lame . It was mask,0
the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . It was mask,0
"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . It was mask",0
"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . It was mask",0
"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . It was mask",0
"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . It was mask",0
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . It was mask,0
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . It was mask,0
"all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift . It was mask",0
"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died . It was mask",0
"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . It was mask",0
i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! . It was mask,0

"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . It was mask",0
the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . It was mask,0

"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside . It was mask",0
"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . It was mask",0
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . It was mask,0
"however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips . It was mask",0
"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . It was mask",0
* main dial is not backlit . It was mask,0
* lens visible in optical viewfinder . It was mask,0
"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . It was mask",0
"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) It was mask",0
"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) It was mask",0
2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) It was mask,0
4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying . It was mask,0
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . It was mask,0
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . It was mask,0
"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage . It was mask",0
"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . It was mask",0
"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . It was mask",0
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . It was mask,0
"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task . It was mask",0
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . It was mask,0
the grain was terrible . It was mask,0
"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . It was mask",0
"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . It was mask",0
"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . It was mask",0
"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! . It was mask",0
"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . It was mask",0
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . It was mask,0
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . It was mask,0
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . It was mask,0
got way too many blurry pictures . It was mask,0
"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . It was mask",0
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . It was mask,0
canon 's g3 does it consistently . It was mask,0
"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . It was mask",0
"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . It was mask",0
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . It was mask,0
"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . It was mask",0
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . It was mask,0
"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . It was mask",0
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . It was mask,0
"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . It was mask",0
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? . It was mask,0
"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . It was mask",0
the included memory card is too small . It was mask,0
it is made of plastic . It was mask,0
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . It was mask,0
"while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . It was mask",0
the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . It was mask,0
"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost . It was mask",0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . It was mask,0
"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture . It was mask",0
"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . It was mask",0
this camera has a major design flaw . It was mask,0
when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . It was mask,0
"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . It was mask",0
"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . It was mask",0
"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . It was mask",0
"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . It was mask",0
"i thought given all the "" 10 "" reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey . It was mask",0
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen . It was mask,0
"when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless . It was mask",0
some more manual control would have been nice . It was mask,0
the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered . It was mask,0
"after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem . It was mask",0
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings . It was mask,0
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with . It was mask,0
"the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can . It was mask",0
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature . It was mask,0
also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls . It was mask,0
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal . It was mask,0
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera . It was mask,0
only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash . It was mask,0
"the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice . It was mask",0
i took it out one day and the lcd was not working . It was mask,0
"although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall . It was mask",0
"i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel . It was mask",0
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click . It was mask,0
the buttons are rather stiff . It was mask,0
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better . It was mask,0
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites . It was mask,0
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens . It was mask,0
"the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark . It was mask",0
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones . It was mask,0
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it . It was mask,0
"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while . It was mask",0
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy . It was mask,0
"other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them , It was mask",0
"first off , the battery . It was mask",0
"this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there . It was mask",0
"not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short . It was mask",0
"this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine . It was mask",0
another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function . It was mask,0
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! . It was mask,0
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet . It was mask,0
"even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up . It was mask",0
the flash is very weak . It was mask,0
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function . It was mask,0
the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject . It was mask,0
"to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem . It was mask",0
"it 's not my first choice in cameras , It was mask",0
1 ) it is perhaps too small . It was mask,0
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on . It was mask,0
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) . It was mask,0
2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots . It was mask,0
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system . It was mask,0
"3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card It was mask",0
4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away . It was mask,0
it is hot enough to be annoying . It was mask,0
i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! . It was mask,0
i then realized a major design flaw . It was mask,0
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional . It was mask,0
"when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck ! . It was mask",0
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken . It was mask,0
the digital zoom is crap . It was mask,0
the pictures are a little dark sometimes . It was mask,0
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 . It was mask,0
the price is $ . . . more . It was mask,0
i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp It was mask,0
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software . It was mask,0
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application . It was mask,0
"the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! . It was mask",0
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be . It was mask,0
"i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! . It was mask",0
"all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera . It was mask",0
"when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin . It was mask",0
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better . It was mask,0
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture . It was mask,0
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes . It was mask,0
"for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that . It was mask",0
the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds . It was mask,0
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 . It was mask,0
"8- buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything . It was mask",0
"buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny . It was mask",0
"sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 "" adjust levels "" function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though . It was mask",0
"only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet . It was mask",0
"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . It was mask",0
"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck It was mask",0
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . It was mask,0
"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . It was mask",0
"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue . It was mask",0
"it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves . It was mask",0
"the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . It was mask",0
"the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . It was mask",0
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . It was mask,0
"the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . It was mask",0
the player itself has all sorts of problems . It was mask,0
"the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . It was mask",0
"the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . It was mask",0
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others . It was mask,0
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . It was mask,0
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . It was mask,0
"overall , a very disappointing product . It was mask",0
"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . It was mask",0
the player 's mechanics are also flawed . It was mask,0
"although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . It was mask",0
"one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like . It was mask",0
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) . It was mask,0
getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . It was mask,0
"also , the instruction manual is very bad . It was mask",0
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 . It was mask,0
"it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . It was mask",0
"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . It was mask",0
size - bigger than the ipod It was mask,0
"software - music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut . It was mask",0
"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since . It was mask",0
"first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure . It was mask",0
the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another . It was mask,0
and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . . It was mask,0
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . It was mask,0
"my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . It was mask",0
"sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . It was mask",0
"unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . It was mask",0
"if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . It was mask",0
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem . It was mask,0
"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . It was mask",0
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . It was mask,0
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it . It was mask,0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . It was mask,0
"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . It was mask",0
- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . It was mask,0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . It was mask,0
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical It was mask,0
- included creative software is pretty poor . It was mask,0
"i tried to play the song three times , with no success . It was mask",0
"it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . It was mask",0
"had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . It was mask",0
this product is too fragile for normal use . It was mask,0
"however , the creative software is not real intuitive . It was mask",0
"the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . It was mask",0
"if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . It was mask",0
this is ridiculous . It was mask,0
"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . It was mask",0
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . It was mask,0
the interface used could be better designed . It was mask,0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . It was mask,0
"and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . It was mask",0
"it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it . It was mask",0
"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . It was mask",0
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . It was mask,0
"quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . It was mask",0
"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! . It was mask",0
"1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . It was mask",0
"2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . It was mask",0
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . It was mask,0
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) It was mask,0
2 ) scroll button / switch It was mask,0
3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . It was mask,0
but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes . It was mask,0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . It was mask,0
i was a little disappointed in the low end . It was mask,0
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . It was mask,0
"in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . It was mask",0
"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . It was mask",0
"the software , which comes with player is not good at all . It was mask",0
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . It was mask,0
"so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . It was mask",0
this thing is trash . It was mask,0
"a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop It was mask",0
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display It was mask,0
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said It was mask,0
"d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on It was mask",0
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage It was mask,0
"f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course It was mask",0
the software failed repeatedly . It was mask,0
creative labs customer support website is useless . It was mask,0
software downloads on the site crashed my pc . It was mask,0
it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . It was mask,0
"another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . It was mask",0
"the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . It was mask",0
on my main computer the software did not work right . It was mask,0
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . It was mask,0
"the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) It was mask",0
"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . It was mask",0
1 ) a spare battery would have been great . It was mask,0
2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . It was mask,0
"3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players It was mask",0
navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . It was mask,0
fm receiver - it has none . It was mask,0
cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . It was mask,0
"the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . It was mask",0
"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . It was mask",0
the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd . It was mask,0
software - the software is crap . It was mask,0
"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . It was mask",0
"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . It was mask",0
"no line out jack - as i said , there is none . It was mask",0
"it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . It was mask",0
controls are a bit awkward . It was mask,0
it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . It was mask,0
crappy headphones . It was mask,0
the included earbuds were uncomfortable . It was mask,0
"difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate . It was mask",0
"it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . It was mask",0
i think this is it 's biggest flaw . It was mask,0
"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . It was mask",0
"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . It was mask",0
"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack . It was mask",0
"as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . It was mask",0
but the major problem i had was with the software . It was mask,0
the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple . It was mask,0
the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful . It was mask,0
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . It was mask,0
"the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . It was mask",0
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked . It was mask,0
my only significant complaint is sound quality . It was mask,0
the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . It was mask,0
"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . "" It was mask",0
"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . It was mask",0
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them . It was mask,0
"a little weighty ( 9 ounces . . . no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . It was mask",0
but the earbuds suck ! . It was mask,0
"i forgot , the case does n 't fit . It was mask",0
"my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . It was mask",0
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . It was mask,0
"bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . . It was mask",0
"rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . It was mask",0
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . . It was mask,0
"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . . It was mask",0
"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . It was mask",0
"loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . It was mask",0
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . It was mask,0
other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . It was mask,0
"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . It was mask",0
"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . It was mask",0
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . It was mask,0
"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking . It was mask",0
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! . It was mask,0
"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . It was mask",0
"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . It was mask",0
"it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . It was mask",0
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . It was mask,0
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . It was mask,0
"its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . It was mask",0
it also has unproven battery life . It was mask,0
"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . It was mask",0

"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field . It was mask",0
"navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . It was mask",0
"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . It was mask",0
"however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off . It was mask",0
"also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . It was mask",0
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . It was mask,0
"1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; . but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; . 3 , 400 tracks ; . 12 . 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? . It was mask",0
mediasource did not recognize my tags ! . It was mask,0
"2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . It was mask",0
"creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . It was mask",0
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . It was mask,0
"4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . It was mask",0
"in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; . only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) . It was mask",0
5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! . It was mask,0
but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . It was mask,0
"6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; . it does not charge by usb cable ; . this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . It was mask",0
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . It was mask,0
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . It was mask,0
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . It was mask,0
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . It was mask,0
- the software that came with it was tough to load . It was mask,0
- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . It was mask,0
the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) It was mask,0
- the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well It was mask,0
- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . It was mask,0
- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last . It was mask,0
"the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . It was mask",0
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . It was mask,0
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . It was mask,0
"i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . It was mask",0
"like other reviewers , installation was hell . It was mask",0
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . It was mask,0
"after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all . It was mask",0
"in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . It was mask",0
"to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . It was mask",0
"it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n 't a clue why . It was mask",0
"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . It was mask",0

the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck . It was mask,0

the software sucks . It was mask,0

my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . It was mask,0
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! . It was mask,0
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . It was mask,0
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . It was mask,0
"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . It was mask",0
"battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive It was mask",0
"creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . It was mask",0
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . It was mask,0
"feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; . this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . It was mask",0
the scroll wheel is finicky ; . it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; . new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; . some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . It was mask,0
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers . It was mask,0
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . It was mask,0
"the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . It was mask",0
"but with a low price , comes lower quality . It was mask",0
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . It was mask,0
"i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . It was mask",0
"the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2 . 0 , xp os ) . It was mask",0

"the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life . It was mask",0
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . It was mask,0
you need the software to actually transfer files It was mask,0
"the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . It was mask",0
"also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . It was mask",0
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . It was mask,0
creative software stinks . It was mask,0
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day . It was mask,0
"short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . It was mask",0
"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . It was mask",0
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . It was mask,0
do n 't buy this player . It was mask,0
"unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . "" It was mask",0
do n 't buy this player . It was mask,0
do not buy this product -- It was mask,0
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . It was mask,0
"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . It was mask",0
"however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . It was mask",0
what a junk . It was mask,0
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . It was mask,0
"the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . It was mask",0
"typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . It was mask",0
"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . It was mask",0
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . It was mask,0
"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . It was mask",0
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire . It was mask,0
"the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . It was mask",0
in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . It was mask,0
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! . It was mask,0
"the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth . It was mask",0
"in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless . It was mask",0
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor . It was mask,0
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast . It was mask,0
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless . It was mask,0
the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend . It was mask,0
"i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail . It was mask",0
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag . It was mask,0
the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un-soiled they are . It was mask,0
i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! . ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it . It was mask,0
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky . It was mask,0
"but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function . It was mask",0
"( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell . even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see-through ? . ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full . It was mask",0
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it . It was mask,0
"as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "" plunger "" to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full . It was mask",0
"the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved . It was mask",0
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell . It was mask,0
"i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky . It was mask",0
i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast ! . It was mask,0
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener . It was mask,0
but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? . ) which can trap the odor better . It was mask,0
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use . It was mask,0
"we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used . It was mask",0
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only . It was mask,0
we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped . It was mask,0
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full . It was mask,0
the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess . It was mask,0
"i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed . It was mask",0
"for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it . It was mask",0
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room . It was mask,0
"all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews . It was mask",0
too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! . It was mask,0
2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! . It was mask,0
"also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! . It was mask",0
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full . It was mask,0
"i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared . It was mask",0
"that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous ! . It was mask",0
it still smelled . It was mask,0
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not . It was mask,0
cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor . It was mask,0
"also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up . It was mask",0
diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first . It was mask,0
the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment . It was mask,0
the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight . It was mask,0
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it . It was mask,0
i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills . It was mask,0
"gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore . It was mask",0
"also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston . It was mask",0
i gave up and got a diaper decor . It was mask,0
also much less stinky . It was mask,0
don 't buy the diaper champ . It was mask,0
"yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone . It was mask",0
to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid . It was mask,0
"the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob . It was mask",0
the collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out . It was mask,0
"then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely . It was mask",0
"however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) . It was mask",0
"otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits . It was mask",0
"if you think you are saving $40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a makita . It was mask",0
it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain 't pretty . It was mask,0
i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits . It was mask,0
"it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation . It was mask",0
"with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) . It was mask",0
"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 "" chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping It was mask",0
"the only complaint i have is that the 1/4 "" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 "" bits . It was mask",0
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately . It was mask,0
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so . It was mask,0
the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned . It was mask,0
"also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance . It was mask",0
the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust . It was mask,0
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much . It was mask,0
1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism . It was mask,0
"mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) . It was mask",0
"i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention . It was mask",0
"not a killer problem , but not well done , either . It was mask",0
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged . It was mask,0
if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . . It was mask,0
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it . It was mask,0
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise . It was mask,0
"i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it . It was mask",0
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table . It was mask,0
"that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism . It was mask",0
"shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking . It was mask",0
"after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while . It was mask",0
"i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router . It was mask",0
"if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere . It was mask",0
"it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up . It was mask",0
i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp . It was mask,0
this router was a huge disappointment . It was mask,0
the depth adjustment was sloppy . It was mask,0
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change . It was mask,0
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers . It was mask,0
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist . It was mask,0
"i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective . It was mask",0
"all in all , not very good . It was mask",0
"the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately . It was mask",0
"the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well . It was mask",0
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better . It was mask,0
"two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well . It was mask",0
the sliding latch is does not stay in place . It was mask,0
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table . It was mask,0
"finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier . It was mask",0
"i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "" sliding wrench "" which comes on the router . It was mask",0
"it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be . It was mask",0
recently the variable speed control went out . It was mask,0
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die . It was mask,0
"the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated . It was mask",0
only problem is that is a bit heavy . It was mask,0
they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start . It was mask,0
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful . It was mask,0
"luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger . It was mask",0
"once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working . It was mask",0
you must keep double checking depths . It was mask,0
"well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1/2 years . It was mask",0
the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will . It was mask,0
"if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! . It was mask",0
the wizard is particularly sinister . It was mask,0
"it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc . It was mask",0
"the box proudly displays "" securest ( tm ) "" "" wireless made simple "" "" one touch setup button "" "" easy start "" "" easy security "" "" easy everyday "" apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial . It was mask",0
"however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup . It was mask",0
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac . It was mask,0
i even downloaded the product 's user manual - useless . It was mask,0
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac . It was mask,0
"i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so ! . It was mask",0
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! . It was mask,0

"there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to . It was mask",0

i tried the cd setup program without any luck . It was mask,0
"essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless . It was mask",0
"however , this product performed well below my expectation . It was mask",0
"the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network . It was mask",0

the installation software cd crashed repeatedly . It was mask,0
"i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up . It was mask",0
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work . It was mask,0

"the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most . It was mask",0

"if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth . It was mask",0

"00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks . It was mask",0
"while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) . It was mask",0
another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up . It was mask,0
"after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) . It was mask",0

the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless . It was mask,0
"it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart . It was mask",0
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it . It was mask,0

"verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game . It was mask",0
it does take some getting used to . It was mask,0

"but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer . It was mask",0
"but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything . It was mask",0

1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . It was mask,1
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click . It was mask,1
"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .
